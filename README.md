# Feat:React Form Validation : Viktor ðŸ¤–

This project focuses on implementing comprehensive form validation. 
It includes mandatory fields for First Name and Last Name, with additional rules for User Inactivity Date based on User Type. Validation messages appear for invalid and touched fields. The solution utilizes TypeScript, converts the codebase from JavaScript, and employs Jest for unit testing. No third-party form libraries are used.




## Requirement
For this task you need to implement the form shown in the image below the logic for saving the below (/static/media/form-goal.9608ad75.png) as well as the following validation rules:

- First Name and Last Name are mandatory fields.

- User Inactivity Date is mandatory ONLY if the User Type is set to "Inactive".

- User Inactivity Date value must have the format YYYY-MM-DD (This format should also be  configurable).

- User Inactivity Date is only valid if it contains a date that is in the past.

- Validation messages should appear if a field is invalid and was touched.

Additional Requirements

- The task should be implemented inside the component found at: /src/tasks/form-task/FormTaskComplete/FormTaskComplete.js.

- When submitting the form, you should use the saveUserForm function found in /src/tasks/form-task/FormTaskComplete/form-api.js.

- You may create as many sub-components as you deem necessary.
When styling the form, feel free to use CSS, SCSS, React-JSS, or other.

- Feel free to include any UI/UX improvements for the form.

- Do not use any 3rd party form libraries to complete this task.
Testing is required for this task. The testing-library has been included in this project, but please feel free to use any other testing tools (such as enzyme)
